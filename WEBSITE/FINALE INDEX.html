<!-- Information & Resources Section -->
<section id="information-resources" class="section">
    <h2>Information & Resources</h2>
    <p>Mental health is vital for overall well-being. Our resources include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>✔ Guides for managing stress and anxiety</li>
        <li>✔ Tips for building resilience and coping mechanisms</li>
        <li>✔ Hotlines and services for immediate support</li>
        <li>✔ Articles and workshops on mental wellness</li>
        <p><strong>These are the coping mechanisms that peopl often find helpful during difficult times
            like depressive episodes.
            Here are some strategies that many find useful: :</strong></p>
        <li>1. Seek Support: Talk to someone you trust-connection can reduce isolation.</li>
        <li>2. Simplify Tasks: Break activitie into small, manageable steps.</li>
        <li>3. Move Your Body: Light exercise or a walk can boost your mood.</li>
        <li>4. Be Kidnd to Yourself: It's okay to not be okay-show your compassion.</li>
        <li>5. Engage in Calming Activities: Listen to music, journal, or do something soothing.</li>
        <li>6. Celebrate Small Wins: Acknowledge progress, no matter how small.</li>
        <li>7. Consider Professional Help: Reach out to a therapist for tailored support. </li>
        <li>8. Breathe and Be Present: Practice deep breathing or mindfulness to ease anxiety and refocus. </li>
        <p><strong>Depression Statistics Everyone Should Knows:</strong></p>
        <li>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 280 million people worldwide
            have depression, which is approximately 3.8% of the global population.
           <li> This includes:</li>
           <li> 5% of adults and 5.7% adults over 60 years old </li>

            Depression is more common in women in men, affecting about 50% more women than men. 
            However, the actual number of people with depression may be higher because many people don't
            seek professional help. The WHO estimates that more than 75% of people in low-income or
            middle-income countries don't receive treatment for depression.
            
           <li> Depression can affect people of all ages and from all walks of life, but some factors can increase
            the risk of developing it, including:</li>
           <li> ○ Poverty </li>
           <li> ○ Unemployment </li>
           <li> ○ Physical illness </li>
           <li> ○ Life events, such as the death of a loved one or a relationship break-up </li>
           <li> ○ Problems caused by alcohol and drug use </li>

            Given the alarming statistics and the fact that many individuals, particularly in low-income countries, don't receive the
            support they need, it's clear that mental health awareness and accessibility are more important than ever. 
            The creation of Mindful Minds is our response to this urgent need. By providing a safe, supportive space, 
            we aim to raise awareness, reduce stigma, and offer resources to those affected by depression and mental health challenges.
            Our mission is to ensure that no one feels alone in their struggles, empowering individuals to seek help, connect, and heal.
            We are here to remind everyone that mental wellness is a journey, and it's okay to take that journey one step at a time.
